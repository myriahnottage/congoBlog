I grew up in the SF Bay Area, from El Sobrante, to Richmond, to Oakland. I love the Bay with a passion, but I haven't lived there since 2018. First, I moved to Idaho because:

1. I could actually afford to buy a house on a generous $27/hour wage, which would only ever afford rent at home
2. I have family there who I grew up visiting every summer

Then, as much as I adored being near my family in Idaho, I moved to southern california for the weather and the politics -- a topic for it's own article. But why not move back to the bay area? I have amazing friends and family there, it's a place filled with nostalgia for me, and there's the shinning pinnacle of career growth in silicon valley. There are so many good things I could have returned to at home, so... why didn't I?

The bay area had transformed in devastating ways.

The influx of salaries beyond most people's wildest dreams brought with it a housing market geared specifically towards the upper echelons of earnings. There have always been housing inequalities, but in the years between my highschool and college graduations, I personally witnessed an explosion in the number of unhoused people in the bay area. And I noticed a troubling trend in the responses to those speaking out about it; apathy.

A troubling phrase became commonplace: "if you can't afford to live here anymore, then just leave.

The suggestion to people who were already unhoused or could barely afford rent was to pick up and leave. No one bothered answering the question of where folks were supposed to get the money to <b>move</b> when there wasn't enough money to live.

These new realities (new to me, anyway) brought me immense sadness.

But as I reflect now, sadness seems like such a flimsy emotional reaction. Why didn't I get angry? Anger, at least, might have motivated me to action. Anger could have been my fuel for positive impact. Instead, let my *sadness* lull me into complacency.

This is by no means an admonition of sadness itself. How I reacted to my own sadness is what I now take issue with. I had the luxury of being able to leave -- hiding certain ugly aspects of the world from myself -- so I did.

So what can I do **now**? What can others do to protect a place they love against changes for the crueler in the first place?

I've only begun to answer this question for myself. As much as I would love to produce a short, snappy checklist for others to follow, I'm simply not capable at the moment. That said, I will be documenting my own journey through this space, and perhaps some people will find it useful. Regardless, I <b>do</b> encourage you to dig deep; answer for yourself how you serve your communities: your friends, your colleagues, your neighbors. Even the service of listening deeply is service.

Find empathy for people you don't know, and who you might not even understand. I've found that empathy has jolted me awake; it's let me hold space for others instead of wallowing in a sad slumber of inaction and deflection.
